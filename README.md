Pleural Mesothelioma Risk-Optimization Algorithm
===

### Overview ###

I worked on this data science project during the summer prior to my final year of high school in June-July 2017 as I interned at the University of Chicago, Radiology Department. Under the guidance of Dr. Samuel Armato and Eyjolfur Gudmundsson, I developed algorithms and conducted statistical analysis for the optimization of response classification criteria for patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM). Utilizing the post-mortem data of patients with MPM, I worked on a data-driven optimization of patient risk categories using C-statistics and other statistical measures. Using R, I tested the viability of various statistical metrics for determining how patients should be categorized to deem certain patients 'high risk' or 'low risk.' I presented my research at the annual Science SPARK symposium in Chicago.
